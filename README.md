# Event Detail Concealer
This is a chrome extension that when toggled, will hide the details of the events on your calendar so that you can screenshot & share it with only the blocks showing. 

The purpose is to share availability without sharing other life details. 

Example:
![example](images/concealedExample.png)

Next Step:
- Add ability to only hide title, not time
- Take functionality to take a screenshot (& copy it to clipboard automatically)
